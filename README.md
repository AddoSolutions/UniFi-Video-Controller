# unifi-video-controller

This is a docker for use on Unraid 6.x for the UniFi-Video controller.

Please note that on first run, it will create a system.properties that you will need to edit to add on the first line: is_default=true

After that, restart the docker and you'll be great by the Unifi-Video wizard that will let you set a User/Pass for your Unifi-Video controller.
